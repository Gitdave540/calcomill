    "Why did the grappa refuse to travel at the speed of light? It didn’t want to experience 'time dilation' and become too strong!",
    "I tried explaining relativity to my distiller. He said, 'I don’t need Einstein to tell me the best way to 'distill' time!'",

    "Einstein walks into a distillery, and the distiller says, 'E=mc^2? Nah, it’s more like grappa = perfect aging x patience squared!'",
    "I asked my grappa if it could help me understand relativity. It said, 'I’m too strong to explain it, but I can bend your sense of time!'",
    "The distiller was fascinated by relativity—he said, 'Time slows down when I’m aging grappa, but it speeds up when I’m drinking it!'",
    "Grappa: the only drink that can bend both space-time and your perception of reality!",

    "In the future, grappa will be measured in light-years. Why? Because it takes you that far after just one glass!",
    "Medieval knights drank grappa before battle, claiming it made them invincible. Turns out, it just made them miss every swing!",
    "I measured the strength of my grappa using Einstein’s formula: \(E=mc^2\). Turns out, it’s so strong it bends both space and time!",
    "In medieval times, grappa was called 'dragon fire.' Not because of dragons, but because it made you breathe like one!",
    "The futuristic bartender served me grappa and said, 'Careful—this one distills faster than the speed of light!'",
    "Relativity and grappa are similar—both make you question how fast time is actually passing after a few rounds.",
    "In the Middle Ages, distillers were considered wizards. Why? Because they turned grapes into pure magic!",
    "In the future, time travel will be powered by grappa. Why? Because one sip already sends you to another dimension!",
    "A knight asked for grappa before a joust. The bartender said, 'One sip, and you’ll think you’re already victorious!'",

  // Science-based humor
  "Distillation: where science meets the art of making your grapes forget their past.",
